#### _An app that generates a random Fish Personals profile when user clicks button and allows the user to download or save the image and post it to Instagram if they wish. Current version December 2019_

#### By _**Alyssa Colistro (Dev) and Sarah Crisp (Product Owner)**_

## Description

_This app draws from a pre-set list of names, photos, and other data to populate a fish personals "profile". When the user clicks the button to submit, the profile is generated and returned to the user as an image file that the user can then download or post directly to their Instagram_

_Ultimately it should include a feature to allow the user to submit their own input to customize their profile by taking certain data from the user and inserting it into a pre-made template. It also may include a feature to allow user to input data about themselves and be matched with 3 existing fish personals listings._
